# Apollo

## Introduction
Once it's finished, Apollo is expected to be a physically based renderer implementing the classic Monte Carlo path tracing global illumination algorithm without any external libraries. The project heavily relies on C++17 features.

## Features
Here are the features implemented so far:

- Perspective camera model with adjustable FOV and film aspect ratio
- Object, Camera and World Space Support
- Sphere rendering
- Triangle and Triangle mesh rendering (implementing the Möller–Trumbore ray-triangle intersection algorithm)
- RGB Spectrum representation
